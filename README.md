# Student-Database
Student database application created using Java. 
The application will start by asking the user to enter how many students he/she would like to add.
Then the user will be able to type in the first name, last name, class year, and courses he/she would like to enroll in. 
The user will be able to view his/her balance and make a payment if they would like. At the end the user will be able to see a full summary of the student's information.
